# Boss Daddy v2 — Claude Code Rules

> **PRIMARY PROJECT** (as of 2026-04-15)
> This is the active Boss Daddy rebuild. All new feature work, design, and content happens here.
> The legacy WordPress site is at `~/boss-daddy/` — maintenance-only archive.

## Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 App Router, TypeScript strict
- **Auth + DB**: Supabase (`@supabase/ssr`) with Row-Level Security
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude API via `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (`claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- **Email**: Resend (templates in `emails/`)
- **Rate limiting**: Upstash Redis
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Deployment**: Vercel (auto-deploys from `master`)

## Supabase Client Rules

| Context | Import from |
|---|---|
| Client Component (`'use client'`) | `@/lib/supabase/client` |
| Server Component / Route Handler | `@/lib/supabase/server` |
| Admin ops (bypass RLS) | `@/lib/supabase/admin` — server-only |

**Never** use the service-role key in client components.  
**Never** call `supabase.auth.getSession()` for auth checks — always use `getUser()`.

---

## Security Rules

1. **RLS is enforced at DB level** — do not assume application-layer checks are sufficient.
2. **Always sanitize HTML** with `sanitizeHtml()` from `@/lib/sanitize` before any DB write of user-generated content.
3. **Affiliate disclosure is legally required** — the `disclosure_acknowledged` check in `/api/reviews/route.ts` must not be bypassed. Never remove this gate.
4. **API keys stay server-side** — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` must never appear in client code or `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars.
5. **Middleware enforces auth** — `middleware.ts` at root protects `/dashboard` routes and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.

## Claude API Usage

- Model: `claude-sonnet-4-6` (defined in `lib/claude/client.ts`)
- **Use prompt caching** on the system prompt for all Claude calls (pass `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }` on the system text block).
- Rate limit is 10 draft generations per user per hour — do not remove or increase without operator approval.
- Both the draft and moderation endpoints expect **raw JSON responses** — strip markdown code fences before parsing.

---

## Review Status State Machine

```
draft → pending → approved
              ↘ rejected → draft (author edits) → pending
```

- Only `draft` and `rejected` reviews can be edited by authors.
- Only `draft` and `rejected` reviews can be submitted (→ `pending`).
- Only admins can transition `pending` → `approved` or `rejected`.
- `approved` reviews are immutable (no further status changes via API).

---

## DB Migration Workflow

- All schema changes go in `supabase/migrations/` with sequential filenames.
- Never run raw `ALTER TABLE` or `CREATE TABLE` directly in application code.
- Apply via `supabase db push` or paste into the Supabase SQL editor.

---

## Brand Voice

All Claude draft generation uses the Boss Daddy system prompt defined in `lib/claude/client.ts`. Key rules:
- First-person dad voice
- Confident, direct, no corporate speak
- Always reference real testing ("I used this for 3 weekends...")
- FTC disclosure auto-injected for all reviews with affiliate links

---

## Brand Assets

Logo and placeholder images live in `public/images/`:
- `bd-logo-final.png` — primary logo (full)
- `bd-logo-nav.png` — compact nav logo
- `bd-logo-final-favicon.png` — favicon source
- `bd-placeholder.png` / `bd-placeholder.svg` — article image placeholder

---

## What NOT to Do

- Do not add `'use client'` to Server Components — keep data fetching on the server.
- Do not call Supabase admin client from the browser.
- Do not skip the affiliate disclosure gate — it's a legal compliance requirement.
- Do not hardcode product slugs or IDs — always derive from DB.
- Do not commit `.env.local` — use `.env.local.example` as the reference.
